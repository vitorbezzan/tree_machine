## Description

The `defaults.py` file provides a minimal configuration for Auto trees, a system for automated optimization of tree-based models. It defines types, default hyperparameters, and functions for generating parameter distributions used in hyperparameter tuning.

The file begins by importing necessary modules and defining type aliases. It introduces `TDistribution`, a type alias for a dictionary mapping parameter names to various distribution types from Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework.

A `TUsrDistribution` class is defined as a TypedDict, specifying the structure for user-defined hyperparameter distributions. This class includes common hyperparameters for tree-based models such as learning rate (`eta`), regularization parameters (`gamma`, `reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`), and tree structure parameters (`max_depth`, `n_estimators`).

The `defaults` dictionary provides default ranges for a subset of these hyperparameters, serving as a starting point for optimization if the user doesn't specify their own ranges.

The `get_param_distributions` function is a key component of this file. It takes user-defined parameter ranges and converts them into appropriate Optuna distribution objects. This function uses Pydantic's `validate_call` decorator to ensure type safety and allows for arbitrary types in its input.

Overall, this file serves as a configuration module for Auto trees, providing default values and utility functions for hyperparameter optimization of tree-based models.
