## Description

The `classifier_cv.py` file implements a ClassifierCV class, which is an automated classifier based on XGBoost with hyperparameter optimization. This class extends BaseAutoTree and incorporates ClassifierMixin from scikit-learn.

The ClassifierCV class provides a high-level interface for training classification models with automated hyperparameter tuning. It uses Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost classifier. The class supports various options such as custom sampling methods, monotonicity constraints, and interaction constraints.

The main components of the ClassifierCV class include:

1. Initialization: The constructor allows setting the evaluation metric, cross-validation strategy, number of optimization trials, timeout, and number of jobs for parallel processing.

2. Fit method: This method performs the model training and hyperparameter optimization. It supports additional options like custom samplers, monotonicity constraints, and interaction constraints.

3. Predict and score methods: These methods allow making predictions and evaluating the model's performance using the specified metric.

The class also incorporates type checking and validation using Pydantic, ensuring that the input parameters are of the correct type and within acceptable ranges.
