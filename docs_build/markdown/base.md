- xgboost

## Description

The `base.py` file implements a `BaseAutoTree` class that serves as a foundation for building automated tree-based machine learning models. This class inherits from scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` and a custom `OptimizerCVMixIn`, providing a framework for model fitting, prediction, and explanation using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.

The `BaseAutoTree` class is designed to work with XGBoost models and includes functionality for hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and model explanation. It uses pydantic for input validation and type checking, ensuring that the class methods receive the expected input types.

Key features of the `BaseAutoTree` class include:
1. Customizable metric and cross-validation strategy for model evaluation
2. Hyperparameter optimization with configurable number of trials and timeout
3. SHAP-based model explanation capabilities
4. Flexible input handling for both numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames

The class also defines helper methods for input preprocessing and validation, ensuring that the data passed to the model is in the correct format. This base class is not meant to be instantiated directly but serves as a parent class for more specific implementations of automated tree-based models.
