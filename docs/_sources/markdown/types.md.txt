- sklearn

## Description

The `types.py` file provides a set of custom type definitions that are used throughout the tree submodule. These type aliases are designed to improve code readability and maintainability by providing clear and concise representations of common data structures and objects used in machine learning workflows.

The file defines four main type aliases:

1. `Inputs`: Represents input data, which can be either a NumPy array of float64 values or a pandas DataFrame.
2. `Actuals`: Represents actual (target) values, which can be either a NumPy array of float64 values or a pandas Series.
3. `Predictions`: Represents predicted values, which are always a NumPy array of float64 values.
4. `Pipe`: Represents a machine learning pipeline, which can be either a scikit-learn Pipeline or an imbalanced-learn Pipeline.

These type aliases are particularly useful when working with type hinting in Python, allowing developers to specify expected input and output types for functions and methods more precisely. This can help catch potential type-related errors early in the development process and improve overall code quality.

The file also uses the `numpy.typing` module to ensure type compatibility with NumPy arrays, further enhancing type checking capabilities when working with numerical data.
