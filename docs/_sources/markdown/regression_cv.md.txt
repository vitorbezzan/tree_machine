## Description

The `regression_cv.py` file implements a `RegressionCV` class that extends the `BaseAutoTree` and `RegressorMixin` classes to provide an automated regression tree modeling solution. This class utilizes XGBoost's `XGBRegressor` as the underlying model and employs Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

The `RegressionCV` class allows users to specify various options through the `RegressionCVOptions` TypedDict, including monotonicity constraints, interaction constraints, and custom parameter distributions for optimization. The class supports different regression metrics and cross-validation strategies, which can be specified during initialization.

The main functionality of the class is encapsulated in the `fit` method, which performs the model training and optimization process. It uses a scikit-learn Pipeline to combine the XGBoost regressor with any potential preprocessing steps. The optimization process searches for the best hyperparameters within the specified or default parameter distributions using Bayesian optimization.

After fitting, the class provides access to the best model and feature importances. The `score` method allows for easy evaluation of the model's performance using the specified metric.
