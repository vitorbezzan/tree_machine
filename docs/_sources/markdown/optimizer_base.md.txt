## Description

The `optimizer_base.py` file introduces a mixin class called `OptimizerCVMixIn` that adds optimization capabilities to an estimator object using Bayesian optimization. This class is designed to work with machine learning pipelines and utilizes the Optuna library for hyperparameter tuning.

The `OptimizerCVMixIn` class provides methods and properties to set up, run, and analyze optimization experiments. It includes a `setup` method to configure the optimization process, specifying the number of trials, timeout, and whether to return training scores. The class also defines properties to check the optimization status and retrieve results.

The core functionality is implemented in the `_fit` method, which performs the actual optimization using Optuna's `OptunaSearchCV`. This method takes an estimator, input data, target values, a parameter grid, a scoring function, and a cross-validation strategy as inputs. It creates an Optuna study and uses `OptunaSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters for the given estimator.

The class provides convenient access to optimization results through properties like `cv_results_`, which returns a pandas DataFrame containing the scores for each trial, and `study`, which gives access to the underlying Optuna study object.
