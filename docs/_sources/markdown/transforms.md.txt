## Description

The `transforms.py` module provides a collection of transformation classes designed to be used in machine learning workflows, particularly within scikit-learn compatible pipelines. Currently, it contains a single transformation class called `Identity`.

The `Identity` class is a simple yet useful transformer that implements the scikit-learn transformer interface. As its name suggests, it performs an identity transformation on the input data, essentially passing the data through unchanged. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where a transformer is expected in a pipeline, but no actual transformation is needed for a particular step.

The `Identity` transformer adheres to the scikit-learn API by implementing both `fit` and `transform` methods. The `fit` method is a no-op, simply returning the instance itself, while the `transform` method returns the input data unmodified. This design allows the `Identity` transformer to be seamlessly integrated into scikit-learn pipelines and other compatible machine learning workflows.

The module uses type hints to specify the expected input and output types, with `Inputs` and `Actuals` likely being custom type aliases defined elsewhere in the project to represent feature and target data respectively.
