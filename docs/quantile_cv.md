## Description

The `quantile_cv.py` file implements a `QuantileCV` class, which provides automated quantile regression using tree-based models and Bayesian optimization. This class is designed for flexible and robust quantile regression tasks, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

The implementation includes:

1. `QuantileCVConfig`: A Pydantic dataclass that defines configuration options for quantile regression, including:
   - `monotone_constraints`: Dictionary specifying monotonicity direction for variables (0 for none, 1 for increasing, -1 for decreasing)
   - `interactions`: List of lists containing permitted feature interactions
   - `n_jobs`: Number of parallel jobs to use when fitting the model
   - `parameters`: Hyperparameter search space definition (OptimizerParams instance)
   - `return_train_score`: Whether to include training scores during optimization
   - `quantile_alpha`: Parameter specifying the quantile to predict (e.g., 0.5 for median regression)

2. Pre-configured settings:
   - `default_quantile`: A standard configuration using all hyperparameters
   - `balanced_quantile`: A configuration focused on regularization parameters

3. `QuantileCV`: The main class that inherits from `BaseAutoCV` and provides:
   - Automated hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization
   - XGBoost-based quantile regression capabilities
   - Support for custom quantile levels via the `alpha` parameter
   - Integration with scikit-learn's scoring system for quantile regression metrics
   - Parallel processing support

The class uses cross-validation during the optimization process to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting. It supports various regression metrics, with a focus on quantile loss, and leverages Pydantic for configuration validation.

Overall, this module offers a comprehensive solution for quantile regression tasks, combining automated model selection, advanced regression techniques, and robust validation mechanisms.
